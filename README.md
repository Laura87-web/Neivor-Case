## Documentation

# Introduction
This Api helps to find information about payments registered in an account summary. It is common for the legends in bank summaries to contain abbreviated information and it is difficult to know who the payment belongs to.

# General description
Developed in Node.js
This api receives a legend and searches the database provided (in this case by Neivor) for any coincidence that allows us to know if the payment belongs to a user registered in the database.
